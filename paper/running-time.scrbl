One disadvantage to the code in the previous section is that the
running times are tangled with the body of the insertion function.
Even worse, making mistakes when writing @tt{+=} expressions can
produce un-provable claims or cause our proofs about the running times
to be incorrect and useless, as they will prove facts that are
irrelevant to the functions we are using.

To handle this situation, we have written a simple Coq-to-Coq
translation function that accepts functions written in our monad
without any @tt{+=} expressions and turns them into ones with @tt{+=}
expressions in just the right places.

Our translation function accepts a function written in the
monad, but without the monadic type on its result, and produces
one with it. For example, the @tt{insert} function shown on the
left in @figure-ref["fig:translation"] is translated into the one
on the right. As well as adding @tt{+=} expressions, the
translation process also generates a call to @tt{insert_result}
in the monadic result type. The user must define this function 
separately and the translation's output must be used in that
context:
@(apply inline-code (extract insert_log.v "insert_result"))

Unlike the previous version, this one accounts for the larger constant
factors and it also includes a stricter correctness condition to show
that we establish complete functional correctness. Specifically, the
new conjunct uses @tt{SequenceR} (a proposition from our library) to
insist that if you linearize the resulting Braun tree into a list,
then it is the same as linearizing the input and consing the new
element onto the front of the list.

Rather than develop a novel, and potentially controversial cost
semantics, we show the utility of our monad by adopting the
@citet[automatic-complexity-analysis] cost model. This model treats
each function call, variable lookup, and case-dispatch as a single
unit of abstract time. In @figure-ref["fig:translation"], the first
return is annotated with a cost of @raw-latex{$6$} because it
references @raw-latex{$4$} variables, calls @raw-latex{$1$} function,
and does @raw-latex{$1$} case-dispatch. The second return is annotated
with a cost of @raw-latex{$9$} because it references @raw-latex{$6$}
variables (the self-reference is not counted), calls @raw-latex{$2$}
functions, and does @raw-latex{$1$} case-dispatch.

Our translation function is straightforward and is included in the
supplementary materials (@tt{add-plusses/check-stx-errs} in
@tt{rkt/tmonad/main.rkt}). Our monad could support different cost
semantics, without modification, provided a function could map them to
the program's syntax in a straightforward way and provided they met
certain constraints. Specifically, we assume that costs are
compositionally additive. This means that a live heap consumption
cost, such as @citet[albert-heap] or @citet[montenegro-space] could
not be used. However, a semantics like
@citet[machine-checked-union-find]'s that only counts unit cost at
function entry would be straightforward. We implement a simplified semantics
like this. It is particularly interesting because the default,
specific semantics treats all arithmetic operations as having unit
cost, which may not be the most reliable measure as we discuss in
@secref["sec:prims"].

An alternative approach would be to follow
@citet[static-cost-analysis] and build a Coq model of a machine and
programming language. We would then define a cost judgement for this
machine and prove its soundness with respect to the machine's
reduction lengths. Finally, we would show that our monadic types allow
incremental proofs of their cost results. In some sense, this ``deep
embedding'' would be a more direct study of cost and cost proofs, but
it would be no more directly connected with the running time of the
programs, unless we could establish a connection to the OCaml VM and
the hardware itself.
